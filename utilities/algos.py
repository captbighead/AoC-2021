	single character already, and that if it isn't a translation function

	The printing of the map will start in the top left corner by dynamically 
	determining what the minimum x and y values are and iterating from there. It
	will exhaustively reference every point from the top-left corner to the

		map: The dictionary to display. 
		translation: A function that is expected to convert the values in map to
			a single character string. Defaults to an identity function.
		prefix: String printed before every row begins. Intended as a way to set
			indentation levels for the map, defaults to a tab character
		bounds: The maximum side length for a map. Setting this to a value less
			than the map size causes the function to gracefully exit.
